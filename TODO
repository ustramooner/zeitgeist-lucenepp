===============
Ontology Branch
===============

What needs to be done to

 * get this branch ready to land
    * add more tests
    * (DONE) add more documentation
    * document API changes
    * document DB changes
    * write converter script for the DB
    * check known clients and convert Symbol names from UPPERCASE to CamelCase
      (dataprovider/tests/GAJ)
 
 * When this branch lands, we still need to
    * Implement query expansion, both for:
        * Event/Subject.matches_template(), and
        * SQL

 * consider the related blueprint as implemented
    * (DONE) add more ontologies
    * build-time/packaging magic to use ontologies shipped in a distribution
      package instead of our copies (*not sure about this*)
