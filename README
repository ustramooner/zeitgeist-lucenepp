The Zeitgeist Engine
--------------------

Zeitgeist is a service that logs the users activity. The log can be queried
and managed in various ways over a DBus API.

This package contains the Zeitgeist Daemon, which is for all intents an
purposes an idle service. To take advantage of the Zeitgeist Daemon you
something that insert log statements into it (also known as data providers or
data sources) and you need some applications (or application plugins) to
query and display the logged data.

Zeitgeist Data Providers
------------------------

There is a host of data providers developed for Zeitgeist. There is a more
or less canonical data provider known as the Zeitgeist Data Hub, but note
that it is not more canonical that you can go without it if that is the better
option for you. The Zeitgeist Data Hub is hosted on Launchpad:

  https://launchpad.net/zeitgeist-datahub

There is also a suite of extra data providers which is available for
your cherry picking pleasure:

  https://launchpad.net/zeitgeist-dataproviders

Zeitgeist Client Libraries
--------------------------

For Python development this package also contains a complete async client
for working with the Zeitgeist DBus API. The API documentation can be build
if you have Sphinx installed, otherwise you can browse it online at:

 http://zeitgeist-project.com/documentation/

A GObject/C library for working with the Zeitgeist DBus API is available at:

  https://launchpad.net/libzeitgeist

A CLI/C# library is available from:

  https://launchpad.net/zeitgeist-sharp

You can also find the documentation for the raw DBus API on:

  http://zeitgeist-project.com/documentation/

Zeitgeist GUIs and Plugins
--------------------------

The Gnome Activity Journal (also known as just GAJ) is hosted on:

  https://launchpad.net/gnome-activity-journal

Or a light Zeitgeist powered file browser known as Sezen:

  https://launchpad.net/sezen

The Unity Shell (https://launchpad.net/unity) uses Zeitgeist in an indirect
way by querying its two data daemons; unity-place-files and
unity-place-applications:

  https://launchpad.net/unity-place-files
  https://launchpad.net/unity-place-applications


Zeitgeist Extensions
--------------------

You can write extensions for the core Zeitgeist daemon. These are written in
Python an run directly inside the Zeitgeist Daemon process with raw access to
the underlying database. This is not normally something you need to do, but
if you have very special needs that are unlikely to get accepted in the core
Zeitgeist Daemon you can almost certainly get away with with doing it as an
extension.

There is a collection of Zeitgeist Extensions developed on:

  https://launchpad.net/zeitgeist-extensions

Notably this suite of extensions contain the Zeitgeist Full Text Search (FTS)
extension which is needed by some GUI tools in order to give full text search
capabilities to the daemon.

Extensions can be deployed simply by dropping a Python module in either
$PREFIX/share/zeitgeist/_zeitgeist/engine/extensions or for developers and the
adventurous users they can be deployed in the home directory under
~/.local/share/zeitgeist/extensions/. Note that user extensions take precendence
over the system installed ones.
